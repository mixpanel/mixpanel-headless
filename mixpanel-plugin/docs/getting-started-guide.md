## What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.10 or later** — Check with `python3 --version`
- **pip or uv** — A Python package installer (`pip` comes with Python; [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is faster)
- **A Mixpanel account** with access to a project
- **One of the following** for authentication:
  - A **service account** (username + secret) from your Mixpanel project settings, OR
  - A browser for **OAuth login** (interactive — your project is auto-discovered)

For service accounts, you'll also need your **Mixpanel Project ID**, which you can find in your Mixpanel project settings under "Project Details." For OAuth login, your projects are discovered automatically.

---

## Part 1: Install the Package

The `mixpanel_headless` package installs both the Python library and the `mp` command-line tool.

### Option A: Install with pip

```bash
pip install mixpanel-headless
```

### Option B: Install with uv (faster)

```bash
uv pip install mixpanel-headless
```

### Verify the Installation

```bash
mp --version
```

You should see a version number printed. If you get "command not found," make sure your Python scripts directory is on your `PATH`. You can also run the CLI with:

```bash
python3 -m mixpanel_headless --version
```

---

## Part 2: Authenticate with Mixpanel

You need to connect `mixpanel_headless` to your Mixpanel project. The recommended path is the one-shot `mp login`; service accounts and env-var setups are also supported.

### Option A: `mp login` (Recommended)

Run one command and follow the prompts:

```bash
mp login
```

`mp login` opens your browser for the PKCE flow, derives the account name from your Mixpanel org, and pins a default project. If you have several accessible projects, it shows a numbered picker; if you have one, it auto-picks. Tokens land at `~/.mp/accounts/<name>/tokens.json` (mode `0o600`) and refresh automatically on expiry.

The command auto-detects your auth type from the environment:

| Env vars present | Auth type used | Region behavior | Persistence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MP_USERNAME` + `MP_SECRET` | `service_account` | probes `us → eu → in` | username + secret saved to `~/.mp/config.toml` |
| `MP_OAUTH_TOKEN` | `oauth_token` | probes `us → eu → in` | bearer saved inline to `~/.mp/config.toml` (use `--token-env VAR` to save a pointer instead) |
| Neither | `oauth_browser` (PKCE) | defaults to `us` (pass `--region eu\|in` for other clusters) | refresh-capable tokens at `~/.mp/accounts/<name>/tokens.json` |

For a truly non-persistent flow, set the env vars and skip `mp login` — see Option C below.

Useful flags: `--region {us\|eu\|in}` sets the region explicitly (skips the probe for SA / token paths), `--project ID` skips the picker, `--name NAME` overrides the derived account name, `--service-account` / `--token-env VAR` force a non-browser path.

Verify the connection:

```bash
mp session
```

### Option B: Service Account (Recommended for Scripts & CI/CD)

Service accounts are ideal for automation. You'll need a **service account username** and **secret** from your Mixpanel project settings (Settings > Service Accounts).

For a registered account on disk, set `MP_SECRET` and run:

```bash
export MP_SECRET="your-service-account-secret"
mp account add my-project --type service_account \
    --username YOUR_SA_USERNAME --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID --region us
```

(For non-interactive contexts, pipe the secret via `--secret-stdin` instead of exporting it.)

Then verify the connection:

```bash
mp account test
```

You should see a success message confirming the credentials work.

### Option C: Environment Variables (Quick Setup)

For a quick, temporary setup (useful for trying things out), you can export environment variables — the resolver picks them up directly without account registration:

```bash
export MP_USERNAME="your-service-account-username"
export MP_SECRET="your-service-account-secret"
export MP_PROJECT_ID="12345"
export MP_REGION="us"
```

These take effect immediately for any `mp` command or Python script in the same terminal session. For an OAuth bearer token instead of a service account, set `MP_OAUTH_TOKEN` + `MP_PROJECT_ID` + `MP_REGION` (the service-account quad takes precedence when both sets are complete).

### Where Credentials Are Stored

Account records and the active session live in `~/.mp/config.toml`. OAuth browser tokens are stored per-account at `~/.mp/accounts/<name>/tokens.json` (mode `0o600`) and refreshed automatically on expiry. These files are created automatically when you run `mp login` (or the explicit `mp account add` + `mp account login`) — you should never need to edit them by hand.

---

## Part 3: Explore Your Data with the CLI

Now that you're authenticated, explore what's in your Mixpanel project.

### List All Events

```bash
mp inspect events
```

This shows every event type being tracked in your project.

### View Properties for a Specific Event

```bash
mp inspect properties --event "Signup"
```

Replace `"Signup"` with any event name from the previous command.

### See Saved Funnels and Cohorts

```bash
mp inspect funnels
mp inspect cohorts
```

### Change the Output Format

All commands support `--format` to control how results are displayed:

```bash
mp inspect events --format table    # Human-readable table
mp inspect events --format json     # Machine-readable JSON
mp inspect events --format csv      # Spreadsheet-friendly CSV
```

---

## Part 4: Run Analytics Queries

### Segmentation Query (Event Trends)

See how often an event occurred over a date range:

```bash
mp query segmentation --event "Signup" --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Break Down by Property

Add `--on` to break results down by a property:

```bash
mp query segmentation --event "Purchase" --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD --on country
```

### Funnel Conversion

Query a saved funnel by its ID (find IDs with `mp inspect funnels`):

```bash
mp query funnel 12345 --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Filter JSON Output with --jq

Commands that return JSON support `--jq` for inline filtering:

```bash
# Get only the first 5 events
mp inspect events --format json --jq '.[:5]'

# Extract just event names
mp inspect events --format json --jq '.[].name'
```

### Format as a Table

```bash
mp query segmentation --event "Login" --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD --format table
```

---

## Part 5: Use the Python API

The Python library gives you the full power of `mixpanel_headless` with pandas DataFrames for analysis.

### Basic Setup

```python
import mixpanel_headless as mp

# Creates a Workspace using your saved credentials
ws = mp.Workspace()
```

### Discover Your Data

```python
# List all events in your project
events = ws.events()
print(events)

# List properties for a specific event
props = ws.properties("Purchase")
print(props)
```

### Run an Insights Query

```python
# Simple event count over the last 30 days
result = ws.query(InsightsQuery(events=["Signup"], last=30, unit="day"))
print(result.df)  # pandas DataFrame
```

### Insights with Breakdown and Filter

```python
from mixpanel_headless import Filter, GroupBy, InsightsQuery

# Purchase revenue by plan type, filtered to US customers
result = ws.query(InsightsQuery(
    events=["Purchase"], math="total",
    math_property="amount",
    where=[Filter.equals("country", "US")],
    group_by=["plan_type"],
    last=30,
))
print(result.df)
```

### Funnel Query

```python
# Define funnel steps inline — no saved funnel needed
funnel = ws.query_funnel(FunnelQuery(
    steps=["Signup", "Onboarding Complete", "First Purchase"],
    conversion_window=7,
    last=90,
))
print(f"Overall conversion: {funnel.overall_conversion_rate:.1%}")
print(funnel.df)
```

### Retention Query

```python
# How many users who signed up came back to log in?
retention = ws.query_retention(RetentionQuery(
    born_event="Signup", return_event="Login", retention_unit="week",
    last=90,
))
print(retention.df.head())  # cohort_date | bucket | count | rate
```

### Flow Query (User Paths)

```python
# What do users do after signing up?
flow = ws.query_flow(FlowQuery(event="Signup", forward=4))
print(flow.top_transitions(5))     # Top 5 most common paths
print(flow.drop_off_summary())     # Where users drop off
```

### User Profile Query

```python
from mixpanel_headless import Filter

# Pull profile fields for high-value users
result = ws.query_user(
    where=Filter.greater_than("purchase_count", 10),
    properties=["$name", "$email", "plan"],
    limit=None,                      # fetch every match (None = no cap)
)
print(result.df.head())              # distinct_id | $name | $email | plan
```

### Stream Events

For processing large datasets without loading everything into memory:

```python
for event in ws.stream_events(from_date="2025-06-01", to_date="2025-06-30"):
    print(event["event"], event["properties"]["distinct_id"])
```

---

## Part 6: Set Up the Claude Code Plugin

The Claude Code plugin turns Claude into a Mixpanel data analyst. Instead of writing queries yourself, you ask questions in plain English and Claude writes and runs the Python code for you.

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed (CLI, desktop app, or web app)
- Plugins enabled in Claude Code

### Install the Plugin

In your Claude Code session, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add mixpanel/mixpanel-headless
/plugin install mixpanel-headless@mixpanel-headless-marketplace
```

### Run the Setup Skill

After installing, run the setup skill to install dependencies and verify authentication:

```
/mixpanel-headless:setup
```

This will:

1. Check that Python 3.10+ is available
2. Install the `mixpanel_headless` package and its dependencies (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, networkx, etc.)
3. Verify that your Mixpanel credentials are configured
4. Report the status of your connection

### Configure Credentials (If Not Already Done)

If the setup skill reports that no credentials are found, use the `/mixpanel-headless:auth` command:

```
/mixpanel-headless:auth account add my-project
```

Claude will guide you through entering your service account username, project ID, and region. You'll be prompted to run a shell command that securely collects your secret. For OAuth, the simplest path is `! mp login` — it opens the browser, derives the account name, and pins a project. The browser path defaults to the `us` region; EU and India users should pass `--region eu` or `--region in`. Use `/mixpanel-headless:auth account add personal --type oauth_browser --region us` followed by `/mixpanel-headless:auth account login personal` if you need explicit control over the account name at registration time.

### Ask Analytics Questions

Once authenticated, just ask Claude questions in natural language:

```
"How many signups did we get last week?"

"Where do users drop off in the checkout funnel?"

"Do users who complete onboarding retain better than those who don't?"

"What's the most common path after a user signs up?"

"Build me a weekly KPI dashboard for the product team."
```

Claude will choose the right query engine (Insights, Funnels, Retention, Flows, or Users), write and execute the Python code, and explain the results.

### What's in the Plugin

The plugin ships three skills that Claude loads automatically when relevant:

| Skill | Trigger | What It Does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **setup** | `/mixpanel-headless:setup` (manual) | Installs `mixpanel_headless` + analytics dependencies and verifies credentials. |
| **mixpanelyst** | Auto-loads on analytics questions | Distilled `Workspace` API reference, discovery workflow, exploratory analysis playbook, and live `help.py` lookup for method signatures, types, and enums. |
| **dashboard-expert** | Auto-loads on dashboard questions | Four-mode workflow (Analyze, Build, Modify, Explain) for Mixpanel dashboards, with 9 design templates, chart-type selection, and layout reference. |

The `/mixpanel-headless:auth` slash command provides a guided wrapper around `mp account / project / workspace / target / session / bridge` for managing credentials without leaving the conversation.

---

## Part 7: Set Up Claude Cowork

[Claude Cowork](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cowork) lets multiple Claude agents collaborate on tasks in sandboxed virtual machines. To use `mixpanel_headless` in Cowork, you need to export your credentials from your local machine so the Cowork VM can access them.

### Step 1: Set Up the Credential Bridge (On Your Local Machine)

On your **local machine** (not inside Cowork), export the active account into a v2 bridge file at the default Cowork-readable path:

```bash
mp account export-bridge --to ~/.claude/mixpanel/auth.json
```

This writes a v2 `auth.json` bridge file embedding your full `Account` record (and any `oauth_browser` tokens) so the Cowork session can read your credentials at startup. The default search path inside Cowork is `~/.claude/mixpanel/auth.json` — override with `MP_AUTH_FILE` if you need a custom location.

**Options:**

```bash
# Export a specific named account (defaults to the active account)
mp account export-bridge --to ~/.claude/mixpanel/auth.json --account production

# Pin a project ID into the bridge (overrides the account's default_project)
mp account export-bridge --to ~/.claude/mixpanel/auth.json --project 12345

# Pin a workspace ID into the bridge (needed for dashboard/entity management)
mp account export-bridge --to ~/.claude/mixpanel/auth.json --workspace 3448413
```

### Step 2: Verify the Bridge (Anywhere)

Check that the bridge resolves correctly:

```bash
mp session --bridge
```

This shows the resolved account, project, workspace, and any pinned headers from the bridge file.

### Step 3: Use mixpanel_headless in Cowork

Inside a Cowork session, run the setup skill:

```
/mixpanel-headless:setup
```

The setup script automatically detects the Cowork environment and reads credentials from the bridge file. No additional configuration is needed.

### Step 4: Clean Up (When Done)

When you no longer need Cowork access, remove the bridge file:

```bash
mp account remove-bridge          # removes the default ~/.claude/mixpanel/auth.json
mp account remove-bridge --at /custom/path/auth.json
```

### OAuth Token Refresh

If you authenticated with OAuth, the bridge file embeds your refresh token. The library automatically refreshes expired access tokens inside Cowork — no browser interaction needed. If the refresh token itself is rejected (e.g., revoked at the IdP), you'll need to re-authenticate on your local machine (`mp login --name <name>` or the legacy `mp account login <name>`) and re-run `mp account export-bridge --to ~/.claude/mixpanel/auth.json` to pick up the fresh tokens.

| CSV | `--format csv` | Spreadsheets, data import |
| Plain | `--format plain` | Minimal text output |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: mp"

Your Python scripts directory isn't on your `PATH`. Try running with the full path:

```bash
python3 -m mixpanel_headless --version
```

Or find where pip installed it:

```bash
pip show mixpanel_headless
```

If using `uv`, make sure the virtual environment is activated.

### "Authentication failed" or "401 Unauthorized"

- Double-check your service account username and secret in Mixpanel (Settings > Service Accounts)
- Verify your project ID matches the project the service account has access to
- Make sure the region flag matches your project's data residency
- Run `mp account test <name>` to see the specific error message

### "No credentials configured"

Run one of:

```bash
# Frictionless one-shot login (covers PKCE, region probe, project picker)
mp login

# Service account (set MP_SECRET first, then register)
export MP_SECRET="your-secret-here"
mp account add my-project --type service_account \
    --username YOUR_USERNAME --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID --region us

# Advanced: explicit OAuth browser two-step
mp account add personal --type oauth_browser --region us
mp account login personal
```

### OAuth Token Expired

```bash
# Re-authenticate (refresh token revoked or expired)
mp login --name <name>            # or `mp account login <name>` (legacy)
```

### Plugin Not Working in Claude Code

1. Make sure plugins are enabled in your Claude Code settings
2. Run `/mixpanel-headless:setup` to install dependencies
3. Check auth with `/mixpanel-headless:auth session`
4. If the plugin doesn't appear, try restarting Claude Code

### Cowork VM Can't Find Credentials

1. On your **local machine**, run: `mp account export-bridge --to ~/.claude/mixpanel/auth.json`
2. Verify with: `mp session --bridge`
3. Inside the Cowork session, run: `/mixpanel-headless:setup`
