# Codex pull request review

You are reviewing a pull request in the `mixpanel-headless` repository — the
home of the `mixpanel_headless` Python package and CLI for the Mixpanel analytics
platform.

Read `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root before forming your review. Apply its
conventions, code-quality standards, and architectural rules strictly.

## What to review

The working tree is checked out at the PR's merge commit. The base branch has
been pre-fetched. Inspect the changed files (e.g. `git diff
origin/${base_ref}...HEAD`, or use `gh pr diff` if available) and focus
feedback on:

- **Code quality**: clarity, naming, structure, idiomatic Python.
- **Type safety**: full annotations, `mypy --strict` compliance, no `Any`
  without explicit justification, `Literal` types where applicable.
- **Documentation**: every class, method, and function has a docstring.
  Required sections follow the "Documentation (STRICT)" rules in
  `CLAUDE.md`: Summary always; Args when there are parameters; Returns only
  for non-`None` returns; Raises for exceptions raised deliberately; Example
  only where behavior isn't obvious. A one-line summary is enough for tests
  and fixtures. Examples must use Markdown fenced code blocks, not doctest
  `>>>` syntax.
- **Architecture compliance**: respect layer boundaries (CLI → Public API →
  Services → Infrastructure). No `_internal` leakage in public surfaces.
- **Error handling**: use the project's exception hierarchy. No broad
  `except Exception` without re-raise. No silent fallbacks for conditions
  that shouldn't happen.
- **Test coverage**: this project follows strict TDD. Behavior changes must
  ship with tests written first. Flag missing tests, untested edge cases, or
  coverage regressions. Prefer property-based tests (Hypothesis) for
  invariants.
- **Consistency**: match patterns already used in neighboring modules and
  test files.
- **Security**: avoid command injection, secret leakage, unsafe
  deserialization, or unguarded subprocess calls.

Do not flag what the tooling already enforces: formatting and lint (`ruff`),
type errors (`mypy --strict`), or docstring presence (`interrogate`). Focus
on what those tools can't see.

## How to respond

- Be concrete. Reference file paths and line numbers (e.g.
  `src/mixpanel_headless/workspace.py:142`).
- Group findings by severity: **Blocking** → **Important** → **Nit**.
- Lead with the highest-impact issues.
- If the diff is clean, say so explicitly — do not invent issues to fill
  space.
- Use Markdown so the response renders well as a GitHub PR comment.
- This is a review-only task. Do **not** modify files, run formatters, or
  apply patches. Produce only the final review message.
