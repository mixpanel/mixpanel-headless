"""Cross-project iteration patterns (US7 / T083).

Demonstrates the two supported flows for working across multiple Mixpanel
projects within a single Python session:

1. **Sequential mode** — mutate a single :class:`mixpanel_headless.Workspace`
   in place via ``ws.use(project=...)``. The connection pool, auth header
   (when account is unchanged), and ``/me`` cache are all reused — each
   iteration is O(1) per FR-061 / SC-008.
2. **Snapshot mode** — derive immutable :class:`mixpanel_headless.Session`
   snapshots via ``base_session.replace(project=...)`` and dispatch
   them across worker threads with :class:`ThreadPoolExecutor`. Each
   thread builds its own ``Workspace`` from the snapshot; nothing
   mutates shared state.

The sequential pattern is the right default — switching is cheap, the
HTTP client is shared, and the ``/me`` cache populates once. Snapshot
mode is the parallel-execution escape hatch.
