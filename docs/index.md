## Why This Exists

Mixpanel's web UI is built for interactive exploration. But many workflows need something different: scripts that run unattended, notebooks that combine Mixpanel data with other sources, agents that query analytics programmatically, or pipelines that move data between systems.

`mixpanel_headless` provides direct programmatic access to Mixpanel's analytics platform. Core analytics—typed insights queries, typed funnel queries, typed retention queries, typed flow queries, typed user profile queries, segmentation, saved reports—plus capabilities like streaming data extraction are available as Python methods or shell commands.

## Two Interfaces, One Capability Set

**Python Library** — For notebooks, scripts, and applications:

```python
import mixpanel_headless as mp

ws = mp.Workspace()

# Discover what's in your project
events = ws.events()
props = ws.properties("Purchase")
values = ws.property_values("country", event="Purchase")
funnels = ws.funnels()
cohorts = ws.cohorts()
bookmarks = ws.list_bookmarks()

# Manage entities
dashboards = ws.list_dashboards()
cohort = ws.create_cohort(mp.CreateCohortParams(name="Power Users"))
flags = ws.list_feature_flags()
experiments = ws.list_experiments()

# Operational tooling
alerts = ws.list_alerts()
annotations = ws.list_annotations(from_date="2025-01-01")
webhooks = ws.list_webhooks()

# Data governance
event_defs = ws.get_event_definitions(names=["Signup"])
drop_filters = ws.list_drop_filters()
custom_props = ws.list_custom_properties()
lookup_tables = ws.list_lookup_tables()

# Schema governance
schemas = ws.list_schema_registry()
enforcement = ws.get_schema_enforcement()
audit = ws.run_audit()

# Insights queries — typed, composable analytics
from mixpanel_headless import Metric, Filter, Formula

# Simple event query (last 30 days by default)
result = ws.query("Login")
print(result.df)

# DAU with breakdown
result = ws.query("Login", math="dau", group_by="platform", last=90)

# Multi-metric formula: conversion rate
result = ws.query(
    [Metric("Signup", math="unique"), Metric("Purchase", math="unique")],
    formula="(B / A) * 100",
    formula_label="Conversion Rate",
    unit="week",
)

# Filtered aggregation with numeric breakdown
result = ws.query(
    "Purchase",
    math="total",
    math_property="amount",
    where=[Filter.equals("country", "US"), Filter.greater_than("amount", 50)],
    group_by="platform",
)

# Typed funnel query — define steps inline
funnel_result = ws.query_funnel(
    ["Signup", "Add to Cart", "Purchase"],
    conversion_window=7,
    last=90,
)
print(funnel_result.overall_conversion_rate)

# Typed retention query — cohort retention with event pairs
from mixpanel_headless import RetentionEvent
retention_result = ws.query_retention(
    "Signup",
    "Login",
    retention_unit="week",
    last=90,
)
print(retention_result.df.head())  # cohort_date | bucket | count | rate

# Typed flow query — analyze user paths through your product
from mixpanel_headless import FlowStep
flow_result = ws.query_flow("Purchase", forward=3, reverse=1)
print(flow_result.nodes_df.head())   # step | event | type | count
print(flow_result.top_transitions(5))

# Typed user profile query — search and aggregate user profiles
from mixpanel_headless import Filter
result = ws.query_user(
    where=Filter.equals("plan", "premium"),
    properties=["$email", "$name", "ltv"],
    sort_by="ltv",
    sort_order="descending",
    limit=50,
)
print(f"{result.total} premium users")
print(result.df)

# Cohort-scoped queries — filter, break down, or track cohorts
from mixpanel_headless import CohortCriteria, CohortDefinition, CohortBreakdown, CohortMetric

# Define a cohort inline and use it immediately
power_users = CohortDefinition(
    CohortCriteria.did_event("Purchase", at_least=3, within_days=30)
)
result = ws.query("Login", where=Filter.in_cohort(power_users, name="Power Users"))
result = ws.query("Login", group_by=CohortBreakdown(power_users, name="Power Users"))
result = ws.query(CohortMetric(123, "Power Users"), last=90, unit="week")

# Legacy live queries
segmentation = ws.segmentation(
    event=events[0],
    from_date="2025-01-01",
    to_date="2025-01-31",
    on="country"
)

funnel = ws.funnel(
    funnel_id=funnels[0].id,
    from_date="2025-01-01",
    to_date="2025-01-31"
)

# Stream events for processing
for event in ws.stream_events(from_date="2025-01-01", to_date="2025-01-31"):
    process(event)

# Results have .df for pandas interoperability
result.df
segmentation.df
funnel.df
```

**CLI** — For shell scripts, pipelines, and agent tool calls:

```bash
# Discover your data landscape
mp inspect events
mp inspect properties --event Purchase
mp inspect values --event Purchase --property country
mp inspect top-events
mp inspect funnels
mp inspect cohorts
mp inspect bookmarks

# Manage entities
mp dashboards list

mp query frequency "Login" --from 2025-01-01

# Filter with built-in jq
mp query segmentation "Purchase" --from 2025-01-01 --format json --jq '.total'

# Stream events via Python API (memory-efficient for large datasets)
# for event in ws.stream_events(from_date="2025-01-01", to_date="2025-01-31"):
#     process(event)
```

## Capabilities

**Discovery** — Rapidly explore your project's data landscape:

- List all events, drill into properties, sample actual values
- Browse saved funnels, cohorts, and reports (bookmarks)
- Access Lexicon definitions from your data dictionary
- Inspect top events by volume

Discovery commands let you survey what exists before writing queries—no guessing at event names or property values.

**Insights Queries** — Typed, composable analytics using Mixpanel's Insights engine:

- DAU / WAU / MAU and unique user metrics
- Multi-metric comparison on a single chart
- Formula-based metrics (conversion rates, ratios)
- Per-user aggregation (average purchases per user)
- Rolling and cumulative analysis modes
- Percentiles (p25, p75, p90, p99, custom percentiles, histogram distributions)
- Typed filters (`Filter.equals()`, `Filter.greater_than()`, date filters like `Filter.in_the_last()`, etc.)
- Cohort-scoped queries — filter by cohort, break down by cohort membership, or track cohort size over time, using saved cohort IDs or inline `CohortDefinition` objects
- Property breakdowns with numeric bucketing
- Results as DataFrames, persistable as saved reports

**Live Queries** — Execute Mixpanel analytics directly:

- Segmentation with filtering, grouping, and time bucketing
- Typed funnel queries with ad-hoc step definitions, exclusions, and conversion windows
- Typed retention queries with event pairs, custom buckets, alignment modes, and segmentation
- Typed flow queries with path analysis, direction controls, and visualization modes
- Typed user profile queries with filtering, sorting, property selection, and aggregation
- Funnel conversion analysis (legacy saved funnels)
- Retention analysis (legacy)
- Saved reports (Insights, Funnels, Flows, Retention)
- User activity feeds
- Frequency and engagement analysis
- Numeric aggregations (sum, average, bucket)

**Entity Management** — Create, update, and delete Mixpanel entities:

- Full CRUD for dashboards, reports (bookmarks), cohorts, feature flags, experiments, alerts, annotations, and webhooks
- Bulk operations for efficient batch management
- Dashboard features: favorites, pins, blueprint templates, RCA dashboards
- Report history tracking and linked dashboard discovery
- Feature flag lifecycle (enable/disable/archive) with test users and history
- Experiment lifecycle management (draft/launch/conclude/decide)
- Alert monitoring: trigger history, test notifications, screenshot URLs, bookmark validation
- Timeline annotations with tagging system
- Webhook management with connectivity testing

**Data Governance** — Define and control your data taxonomy:

- Lexicon definitions: manage event and property metadata, tags, descriptions, visibility
- Drop filters: suppress unwanted events at ingestion
- Custom properties: create computed properties from formulas or behaviors
- Custom events: manage composite event definitions
- Lookup tables: upload, download, and manage CSV reference data for property enrichment
- Tracking metadata, change history, and bulk export for audit and governance workflows

**Streaming** — Process data without storage:

- Stream events directly for ETL pipelines
- One-time processing without local persistence
- Memory-efficient iteration over large datasets

## For Humans and Agents

The structured output and deterministic command interface make `mixpanel_headless` particularly effective for AI coding agents—the same properties that make it scriptable for humans make it reliable for automated workflows.

Discovery commands are particularly valuable: an agent can rapidly survey your data landscape—listing events, inspecting properties, sampling values—then construct accurate queries based on what actually exists rather than guessing.

The tool is designed to be self-documenting: comprehensive `--help` on every command, complete docstrings on every method, full type annotations throughout, and rich exception messages that explain what went wrong and how to fix it. Agents can discover capabilities, learn correct usage, and recover from mistakes autonomously.
