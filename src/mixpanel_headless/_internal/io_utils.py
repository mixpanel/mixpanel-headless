"""Atomic on-disk write primitive, credential-read helpers, and bounded stdin reader.

Every persisted credential / config write goes through
:func:`atomic_write_bytes` so a SIGKILL or power loss between
``open()`` and ``rename()`` cannot leave a half-written file in place
of the prior good copy. The implementation uses ``O_EXCL`` (no
``umask`` handoff — process-global, not thread-safe) plus
``os.replace`` (POSIX-atomic same-filesystem rename).

Durability (``fsync``) is intentionally NOT performed: this helper
guarantees atomicity-on-success, not survival across power loss
mid-write. Adding ``fsync`` would cost 5–50 ms per CLI invocation
for no win in the realistic failure modes for a desktop CLI.

:func:`read_credential_bytes` / :func:`read_credential_text` are the
read-side mirror. On POSIX they walk every path component with
``openat(O_NOFOLLOW | O_CLOEXEC)`` so the kernel refuses to traverse
a symlink at any component (final OR intermediate). After open, the
fd is ``fstat``ed for three structural invariants: regular file
(rejects FIFOs/devices), owner-only mode (no group/world bits), and
size at most :data:`MAX_CREDENTIAL_BYTES`. Same-UID symlink attacks
(CI runners with shared ``$HOME``, container images with shared
mounts, compromised local tooling running as the user) are the
threat model — see :class:`CredentialPathError` for what gets raised
and the helper docstrings for what's deliberately out of scope (hard
links, attacker-controlled ``$HOME``).

:func:`read_capped_secret_from_stdin` is the shared stdin reader for
service-account secrets and OAuth bearers. The cap rejects multi-MB
pastes (e.g. an SSH key piped by mistake) before the value reaches
the credential store.

    """Atomically write ``data`` to ``path`` with the requested file mode.

    Writes ``data`` to a sibling ``<name>.tmp.<pid>.<tid>`` path created
    via ``os.open(O_EXCL)``, then ``os.replace``s it onto ``path``. On
    POSIX, ``os.replace`` is atomic on the same filesystem — readers
    observe either the prior file or the new file, never a mix.

    The tmp filename embeds both the process ID and the OS thread ID so
    concurrent writers (threads or async tasks) within the same process
    pick distinct tmp paths and do not collide on the EXCL guard.

    On any failure between tmp creation and the rename, the tmp file is
    cleaned up and the original ``path`` is left untouched.

    Parent directories are NOT created — callers are responsible for
    ensuring ``path.parent`` exists with appropriate permissions.

    The tmp file is always created with mode ``0o600`` (owner-only)
    regardless of the requested ``mode`` — only the final file picks up
    ``mode`` via :func:`os.fchmod`. This guarantees the on-disk view is
    never wider than ``0o600`` for the brief window the tmp file exists,
    even if the caller asked for a more restrictive final mode like
    ``0o400``.

            only ever writes credential-bearing files. Ignored on

    Threat model: a same-UID attacker can plant symlinks anywhere they
    have write access — practically, anywhere under :func:`Path.home`
    (or the configured ``MP_STORAGE_DIR`` / ``MP_CONFIG_PATH`` /
    ``MP_AUTH_FILE`` trees, if those env vars point inside their reach).
    Outside those trees, paths typically traverse system-owned dirs
    (``/var``, ``/private``, ``/Users``) that the user trusts the OS to
    have set up correctly.

    Strategy:

    * If ``path`` is under :func:`Path.home`: dirfd-walk from ``home``
      down to the leaf, with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` at every component. A
      symlink anywhere in the walk raises :class:`CredentialPathError`.
    * Otherwise: open the leaf only, with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` (same as the
      original PR's behavior). The user has explicitly configured an
      out-of-home credential path and accepts that intermediate-symlink
      defense doesn't apply there.

    The dirfd walk uses Python's ``os.open(part, ..., dir_fd=parent)``
    (``openat`` semantics). Each step is atomic w.r.t. the previously
    pinned dirfd, so the walk is TOCTOU-free.

    All opens — root, intermediate, and leaf — use ``O_CLOEXEC`` so
    no descendant subprocess can inherit a live credential fd.

    Windows fallback (no ``O_NOFOLLOW``): single :meth:`Path.is_symlink`
    probe before opening. TOCTOU-vulnerable in theory; not in the

def read_capped_secret_from_stdin() -> str:
    """Read a single secret value from stdin (up to ``SECRET_STDIN_MAX_BYTES``).

    Reads ALL bytes up to the cap, strips trailing whitespace (which
    ``pass``, ``cat``, ``echo`` typically append), and rejects payloads
    larger than the cap rather than returning a quietly-corrupted prefix.
    Used by ``mp account add --secret-stdin`` and the ``mp login``
    orchestrator's SA / oauth_token re-collection paths.

    Returns:
        The decoded secret string with surrounding whitespace stripped.

    Raises:
        ConfigError: When stdin is empty (``CONFIG_ERROR``) or exceeds
            ``SECRET_STDIN_MAX_BYTES`` (``CONFIG_ERROR`` with a hint to
            pipe a single secret rather than a key bundle). The CLI's
            ``@handle_errors`` decorator maps this to the standard
            ``CONFIG_ERROR`` exit code.
