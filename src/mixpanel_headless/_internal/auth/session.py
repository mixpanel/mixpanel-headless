"""Session, Project, and WorkspaceRef value types.

A :class:`Session` is the in-memory representation of "who am I and what
am I working on" — an ``Account`` plus a ``Project`` and an optional
``WorkspaceRef``. Frozen and immutable; switching axes uses
:meth:`Session.replace`.

The naming distinction matters: :class:`WorkspaceRef` is the data type
held inside a Session, while ``mixpanel_headless.Workspace`` (in the public
API) is the facade class. Renaming avoids the collision.
