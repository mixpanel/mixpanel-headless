"""Public ``mp.session`` namespace.

Thin wrapper around :class:`~mixpanel_headless._internal.config.ConfigManager`
exposing the persisted ``[active]`` session and per-axis updates.

Note: this module shadows the :class:`Session` value type. Public
callers access via ``import mixpanel_headless; mp.session.show()`` (module)
or ``import mixpanel_headless; mp.Session(...)`` (the type).
