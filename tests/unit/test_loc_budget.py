"""LoC budget regression test for the v3 auth subsystem (T119, FR-067).

Keeps the auth subsystem from accumulating drift unbounded. Adding a
new auth file or a major code dump will fail this test, prompting the
PR author to either (a) justify the new ceiling or (b) refactor.

Scope (auth subsystem):
    - ``src/mixpanel_headless/_internal/auth/*.py`` (excluding ``__init__.py``)
    - ``src/mixpanel_headless/_internal/config.py``
    - ``src/mixpanel_headless/accounts.py`` — public auth namespace
      (added to scope post-043 after the orchestrator landed: the
      original budget excluded it on the assumption it stayed a thin
      facade, but the ``mp login`` orchestrator pushed it past 1500
      lines and the budget guard would otherwise miss further growth).
    - The five v3 CLI command groups:
      ``cli/commands/{account, project, workspace, target, session}.py``

Note: ``cli/commands/config_cmd.py`` was originally in scope but the
file was deleted along with ``mp config convert`` (Phase 10 dropped per
"alpha free to break").

The ``api_client.py`` file is intentionally OUT of scope: it has
accumulated 8000+ lines of entity-CRUD methods (dashboards / reports /
cohorts / flags / experiments / alerts / data governance) that have
nothing to do with auth. The original spec budget assumed an
api_client split that didn't happen and is out of scope here.

Current ballpark after the 043 rescue: 20 files / ~8,200 LoC.
Re-run ``wc -l`` against ``_auth_subsystem_files()`` to get a fresh
number; the budgets below carry ~7% headroom so a single cleanup
PR doesn't trip the test, but a substantial bloat does.

      orchestrator's growth is also guarded going forward.

      ``_fchmod_no_follow`` in ``storage.py``, and the
      ``reject_if_symlink`` wires at the five call sites.
    - 8900 → 8975 covers the ARB-B (pair-B review, 2026-08-17) token-
      payload redaction hardening in ``flow.py``: the
      ``_redact_token_payload`` allowlist helper + its mandatory full
